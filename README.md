# 99 Bottles of OOP - Ruby
# 2nd Edition

## cseeman version

This is a repo of my study through Sandi Metz's amazing book 99 Bottles 99 Bottle of OOP.

I have treated most chapters as seperate branches, so I can build on the changes like what is seen in the book. I did seperate out the original solutions (and my weak attempt at one.) into seperate branches too. I could have kept those as seperate commits, but I like the ease of just switching branches to see the differences.

In my local dev environment I am using Ruby version 3.1.0, and Neovim as my editor.
